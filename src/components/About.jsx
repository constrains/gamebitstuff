            We were built in 2025, and we were able to grow a lot in such a
            short time, proving what we are capable of. We have worked on a lot
            of the front-page games, and we have invested over 1M$ into games.
            We are one of the biggest hidden studios, with over 10 million
            monthly visits. We were an indie development company, now with more
            developers that focus on growth and getting sales. We deliver the
            best QA and Managing.
